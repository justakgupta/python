This folder contains implementation of basic problems on datastructures. I plan to update only one README file which describes the putpose of each of these python files. I will be using Python3 mostly.


1. takeinputfromterminal.py
PROBLEM: How to take user input from the console using Python3.

2. rotatearray.py
PROBLEM: Write a function rotatearray() that rotates arr[] of size n by d elements.

3. rotatearraybyreverse. py
PROBLEM: Write a function rotatearray() that rotates arr[] of size n by d elements. Uses an algorithm to break the array into two parts, reverse each and then reverse the combination.

4. rearrangeforminutone.py
PROBLEM: Given an array of elements of length N, ranging from 0 to N â€“ 1. All elements may not be present in the array. If element is not present then there will be -1 present in the array. Rearrange the array such that A[i] = i and if i is not present, display -1 at that place.
